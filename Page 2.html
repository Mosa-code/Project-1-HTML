    <h1>My Love For Video Games</h1>
    <h2>How my Love Spawned</h2>
        <p>Like many others, I really started playing Video Games as a Kid, afterschool after homework of course. Nostalgia of those
           those days are high as I remember almost everything I played and ever game/game system I had. Most prominantly though, I 
           remember how I would sit down on the floor, juicebox in one hand and controller on another, and I would pop in one of my
           favorite Characters as a kid, Sonic the Hedgehog. Some games I vividly remmeber playing were <i>Sonic Gems Collection</i>
           and <i>Sonic Heroes</i> for the playstation 2. 
        </p>
    <h2>How that love matured</h2>
        <p>As I got older, so did video games. As a kid, I found it fascinating how much videogame graphics had evolved since the ps2
           era. When I went from Sonic Heroes on the playstation 2 which looked a bit rough around the edges and polygonal, to the HD
           release of Sonic Unleased My mind was blown. I do believe that had something to do with my passion for game design that I have now.
           As an adult, I love reading alot, so It makes sence my favorite games are those that are more story driven. One of my favorite
           franchises is <i>Fire Emblem</i> and <i>Final Fantasy</i>. But my favorite Franchise of all time is <i>Xenoblade Chronicles</i>. 
           It makes me upset seeing also the bad ways that videogames have evolved, Which is when money is at the forefront of the game. recently,
           Micro transactions have taken over some of the most popular franchises like <i>Diablo</i>. Which is an example of a "Gatcha" game,
           Which in my opinion, is just a form of gambling where you get no money out of it, as you can pay 10000 dollars and you won't be guarenteed
           whatever you want. Crypto has also taken over some of the more popular games. NFT's (Non Fungeable Tokens) are a relatively new thing.
           and to see companies add them in beloved games like <i>Ni No Kuno</i> really saddens me, as this is not originally what games were all about.
